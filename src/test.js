/*frameworks used in this build:---
1.react
2.firebase firestore realtime db-- this will power our entire backend all of the hosting functionality and deploying and authentication will be done by firebase only
3 material UI-- from here we get the design of the webpapge
4.react router-- this will allow us to have different page running
5.react context API
6.REDUX
7.Google authentication and after this we will deploy it using firebase


actually material ui is a css library which makes it easy task for ourselves in creating different design
like avatar and many more styling components and we can directly import them after installing the dependencies
